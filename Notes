Stuff I need to do
-------------------

Update the template file so that child templates extend the base html, properly
i.e. add in the title bar, background

I guess login shouldn't really inherit from the master template because it is irrelevant


- Authentication people can just go on the site without an account
Make sure people have to make an account before posting / commenting etc.
